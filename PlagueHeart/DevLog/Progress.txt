Originally this game was called Grimore, I truly wanted to make this work
but sooner than later my interest grew stagnant. My passion for such a 
project was in decline, and so I aim to revive this project as PlaguedHearts.

I hate school, I wish I could be talented like the other developers, I wish 
I could just graduate already and just focus on doing things that are actually
impactful to my life, things I could genuinely enjoy while bettering the world.

I met a girl today, she seems nice. I was in my engineering class, and she was having a hard time setting
up her circuit (im a dunce as well), and offered to help her. Things went well, and we even laughed
a bit (i am probably over exaggerating).

I got my headphones taken away at lunch (I am not entirely sure why, I wasn't bothering anyone but oh well...)
I went back to my seat, noticed her there. I didn't wanna come off as a creep so I said hello and sat down.
Overall it went fairly well (i hope :3), shes a fun person (i also got her insta T.T) jesus I sound like a little girl.
