Originally this game was called Grimore, I truly wanted to make this work
but sooner than later my interest grew stagnant. My passion for such a 
project was in decline, and so I aim to revive this project as PlaguedHearts.

I hate school, I wish I could be talented like the other developers, I wish 
I could just graduate already and just focus on doing things that are actually
impactful to my life, things I could genuinely enjoy while bettering the world.

I met a girl today, she seems nice. I was in my engineering class, and she was having a hard time setting
up her circuit (im a dunce as well), and offered to help her. Things went well, and we even laughed
a bit (i am probably over exaggerating).

I got my headphones taken away at lunch (I am not entirely sure why, I wasn't bothering anyone but oh well...)
I went back to my seat, noticed her there. I didn't wanna come off as a creep so I said hello and sat down.
Overall it went fairly well (i hope :3), shes a fun person (i also got her insta T.T) jesus I sound like a little girl.

Anyways ...

Bug Fixes
    - KravenWares (menu invalid displays)
        - menu loop kept continuing

        - transaction handler invalidity (no item found error loop & insufficent funds)
            - adds sc.nextLine() above loop to consume line before jump
                - FUCKING BULLSHIT THAT BUG TOOK 3 FUCKING WEEKS JUST FOR ONE LINE FUCKING BULLSHIT TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE

Things Learned
    - PissinInn(customer change)
        - I was cnofused why customer dialogue was not being generated randomly, everytime the user wishes to answer a customer or use the mixbook
            - (ISSUE) I was using a variable and assigned the method generating dialogue onto the variable, meaning the value being returned in the method
              will instead be called once and assigned (non change), this is fixed by instead deleting the dead variable and calling the method instead on 
              output
